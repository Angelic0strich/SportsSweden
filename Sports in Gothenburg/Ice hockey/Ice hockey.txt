Frölunda Hockey Club
Also known as the Frölunda Indians
-Swedish professional ice hockey club based in Gothenburg. They play in the highest Swedish league, Swedish Hockey League 
(SHL; formerly Elitserien), where they have played the majority of the seasons during the club's existence. The last time they played in the lower division, Allsvenskan, was in 1995. 
Frölunda have won the national championship title five times, in 1965, 2003, 2005, 2016 and 2019.
-Founded on 3 February 1938, as an ice hockey section in Västra Frölunda IF and became independent on 29 March 1984. Prior to the 1995/1996 season, the nickname Indians 
was adopted. This referring to the successful years of the 1960s, when fans started to call them the "Wild West" (Västra Frölunda is West Frölunda in English). But as they didn't want 
a nickname like cowboys or something with firearms, Indians became the obvious choice. 
-On 16 June 2004, the club shortened the name from Västra Frölunda Hockey Club to Frölunda Hockey Club.
Frölunda's home venue is the Scandinavium arena in central Gothenburg, which has a capacity of 12,044 people. Frölundaborg is used when Scandinavium is occupied with other events. 
Frölunda's average home attendance has been the highest in the league for over a decade.
